# Introduction

I created this JavaScript game, BoBoGotchi, with the aim of providing an engaging and entertaining experience for users while also honing my programming skills. The motivation behind developing this game stemmed from a desire to combine creativity and technology, offering players an enjoyable way to spend their time. I envisioned the game as a means to create something that brings joy and a sense of accomplishment to those who engage with it.

### User experience

My thought process for this game was to create a game in a similar vibe as flappybird. I wanted it to be cute but also slightly frustrating. The icons change quickly for a more rushed and difficult experience. The cute monster, called BoBo, brings good vibes to the page.

### My vision for the game

I wanted the website to look cute and fun. An enjoyable experience, something not too boring. I've optimized the site for all devices, ensuring that whether on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the content remains accessible and aesthetically pleasing. I've paid close attention to loading times to keep the user engaged and prevent frustration. 

<br>

# Features

### Navigation

You first arrive on the start page, which contains a start button that will lead you to the play page. After you press the wrong button and you killed the cutest monster ever, the end page will show. Here is a retry button that will reload the page and you will be back on the start page.

<br>

### Start page

Shows the name of the game at the top that stays there throughout all the pages. The rules for the game are shown underneath the game name. I kept it short for a better user experience. And underneath the rules is the start button that will show the play page.

### Play page

At the top of the page you see your current score, that adds a point everytime you press the correct button. Underneath that is the need icon, that shows what BoBo wants for the next second. It shows a "blank image" (three dots) inbetween every need icon for easier visuals. Underneath the need icon is BoBo. He shows a different facial expression the more points you get. And underneath BoBo are the play buttons, these buttons need to be pressed when the corresponding icon is showing to score points.

### End page

After you've pressed the wrong button and you straigt up murdered the cutest monster, you will be taken to the end page. Here you can see your final score at the top. And underneath that is an image of dead BoBo (how dare you). Finally at the bottom is the retry button that will reload the page and show the start page again.

# Future features

- I want to add a scoreboard that save your previous tries and top score.
- For the need icon, I want to make it so you can only add one point per icon shown.
- I want to add a timer to the need icon that goes quicker the more points you get.
- I want to change BoBo's images more so it doesn't look so static.

<br>

# Design

- <b>Font</b> : I got my font from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- <b>Icon images</b> : I got the images for the play buttons from[flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
- <b>Favicon generator</b> : I made my own favicon with [this website](https://favicon.io/).
- <b>Image resizing</b> : I used this [Image resizer](https://imageresizer.com/) website to change my images.

### Colour scheme

I wanted to use cute and bright colours for a fun look. And I gave it a water melon colour palette. I chose a simple design bit big buttons and not too much distraction.

# Technologies used

- The website is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- I did all my coding with the program VS Code, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- All my code was uploaded to [Github](https://github.com/), to my [Github account](https://github.com/ObiWanBonobi).
- I used Google Chrome Dev Tools to test throughout the process of creating this game.

# Bug fixes

- I initially started the game with creating a need icon that changes after so many seconds. However when I started working on pressing the correct buttons to the corresponding icons shown, I needed to change around that whole bit of code to get it to work. Because I didn't have enough knowledge about javascript, I learned all this while trying out things whilst watching youtube videos.
- I initially made the need icon with two functions which I couldn't get to work, with more practice I realised that I needed to put it into one function.
- I tried to match up the name of the array and the id text, but I didn't have enough knowledge yet of how to do that. I later on scrapped that and used boolean.
- I then had some issues with the images not loading in. I had used incorrect JavaScript paths, which I figured out myself later
- Had some issues with the score not updating. I fixed this with the help of my brother-in-law, who works for Github. He taught me a lot!
- My mentor told me I was using a lot of let and I should have been using const. I changed it all after our meeting.
- I noticed I had some unused lines in JavaScript, I tried to use them and make a line shorter from :  startPage.classList.toggle("none");  to   document.querySelector(".play-page").classList.toggle("none");. That didn't work so I had to turn it back and delete the unused lines for better readability.
- Accidentally left a bit of code at the top of the 404 page from another "how to" video : permalink: /404.html

<b>I have not noticed any existing bugs.</b>
